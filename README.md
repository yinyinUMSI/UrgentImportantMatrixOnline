This one contains the same code as the last repo.

This is a individual project. I use vanilla js, html, css. The database is indexedDB. I intend to use the basic js to finish the whole project, but js can not add event to an element added by js. As a result, I turn to jQuery at the very last part of my project.

Functions:
	Create a note
	Delete a note

Capability:
	May not in a nice format on mobile phone
	
To do checklist:
	Uniform the size of each note so that it won't expand a lot.
	Use media query to fit into small screens.

Achnowledgement:
	I'm still updating. I will attach my blog link here.
